== Rendering documentation locally

Install docs build requirements:

[,bash]
----
make docs-dependencies
----

To render the user-facing documentation site locally:

[,bash]
----
make docs
----

The built HTML files are in `docs_build/dataplane` directory.


There are some additional make targets for convenience. The following
targets, in addition to rendering the docs, will also open the
resulting HTML in your browser so that you don't have to look for it:

[,bash]
----
make docs-preview
----

The following targets set up an inotify watch on the documentation
sources, and when it detects modification, the HTML is re-rendered.
This is so that you can use "edit source - save source - refresh
browser page" loop when working on the docs, without having to run
`make docs-*` repeatedly.

[,bash]
----
make docs-watch
----
