= Data plane conditions and states

[role="_abstract"]
Each data plane resource has a series of conditions within their `status` subresource that indicates the overall state of the resource, including its deployment progress.

For an `OpenStackDataPlaneNodeSet`, until an `OpenStackDataPlaneDeployment` has been started and finished successfully, the `Ready` condition is `False`. When the deployment  succeeds, the `Ready` condition is set to `True`. A subsequent deployment sets the `Ready` condition to `False` until the deployment succeeds, when the `Ready` condition is set to `True`.

.`OpenStackDataPlaneNodeSet` CR conditions
[cols="40%a,60%a",options="header",]
|===
|Condition |Description
|`Ready` |
* "True": The `OpenStackDataPlaneNodeSet` CR is successfully deployed.
* "False": The deployment is not yet requested or has failed, or there are other failed conditions.
|`SetupReady` |"True": All setup tasks for a resource are complete. Setup tasks include verifying the SSH key secret, verifying other fields on the resource, and creating the Ansible inventory for each resource. Each service-specific condition is set to "True" when that service completes deployment. You can check the service conditions to see which services have completed their deployment, or which services failed.
|`DeploymentReady` |"True":  The NodeSet has been successfully deployed.
|`InputReady` |"True": The required inputs are available and ready.
|`NodeSetDNSDataReady` |"True": DNSData resources are ready.
|`NodeSetIPReservationReady` |"True": The IPSet resources are ready.
|`NodeSetBaremetalProvisionReady` |"True": Bare metal nodes are provisioned and ready.

|Status field |Description
|`Deployed` |
* "True": The `OpenStackDataPlaneNodeSet` CR is successfully deployed.
* "False": The deployment is not yet requested or has failed, or there are other failed conditions.

.`OpenStackDataPlaneDeployment` CR conditions
[cols="40%a,60%a",options="header",]
|===
|Condition |Description
|`Ready` |
* "True": The data plane is successfully deployed.
* "False": The data plane deployment failed, or there are other failed conditions.
|`DeploymentReady` | "True": The data plane is successfully deployed.
|`InputReady` |"True": The required inputs are available and ready.
|`<NodeSet> Deployment Ready` |"True": The deployment has succeeded for the named `NodeSet`, indicating all services for the `NodeSet` have succeeded.
|`<NodeSet> <Service> Deployment Ready` |"True": The deployment has succeeded for the named `NodeSet` and `Service`. Each `<NodeSet> <Service> Deployment Ready` specific condition is set to "True" as that service completes successfully for the named `NodeSet`. Once all services are complete for a `NodeSet`, the `<NodeSet> Deployment Ready` condition is set to "True". The service conditions indicate which services have completed their deployment, or which services failed and for which `NodeSets`.
