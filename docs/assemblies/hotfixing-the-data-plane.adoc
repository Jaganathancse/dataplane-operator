The OpenStack DataPlane can be updated when hotfix content is available. Hotfix content
can be delivered as RPM packages or container images. How the software is
installed on the data plane nodes determines how the hotfix content needs to be
applied.

Container hotfix content needs to be applied to the data plane nodes such that
any running containers are updated to run from container images where the
hotfix content has been applied. Container hotfix content could be delivered as
either RPM's or already updated container images.
