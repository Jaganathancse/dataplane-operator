You can update the OpenStack data plane when hotfix content is available. Hotfix content
can be delivered as RPM packages or container images.

You apply a container hotfix to the data plane nodes by updating any running
containers to run from container images where the hotfix content has been
applied. Container hotfix content can be delivered as either RPMâ€™s or already
updated container images.

How the software is installed on the data plane nodes determines which of the
following methods you need to use to apply the hotfix content:

* Node software was installed by using RPMs: Apply the hotfix to the RPM content.
* Node software was installed by using container images: Apply the hotfix to the container content with either RPMs or container images.
